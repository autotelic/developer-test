# Development skills test

Fork this example repo [https://github.com/stonevanzuiden/react-redux-app](https://github.com/stonevanzuiden/react-redux-app)

Follow the instructions in the README. There may be a couple of bugs. Don't panic! See if you can fix them.

Then, given these API endpoints:

  * GET /messages
  * GET /messages/{id}
  * DELETE /messages/{id}
  * POST /messages

at [this url](/), add these features to your forked version of the app:

  * viewing a list of messages with the message text and the date the message was posted
  * viewing all details of a single message on a separate page
  * deleting a message
  * posting a new message

stretch goals:

  * displaying a loading indicator whilst data is being fetched
  * ordering the list of messages to show the most recent first
