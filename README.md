# Development skills test

Given these API endpoints:

  * GET /messages
  * GET /messages/{id}
  * DELETE /messages/{id}
  * POST /messages

at [this url](/), build an SPA that allows the viewer to:

  * view a list of messages, displaying the message text and the date the message was posted
  * view all details of a single message
  * delete messages

Stretch goal:

  * allow posting a new message

The source code for the app should live in a git repository on github (or other hosted VCS) that can be cloned for evaluation.
